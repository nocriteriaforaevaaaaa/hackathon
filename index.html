									Once upon a time, there was a girl named Saros who was
									obsessed with spaces and different scientific occurences.With
									her increasing curiosity, she went to her dad who was an
									astrophysicist but from the thought of bothering him during
									his works, she decided to not trouble him and kept her
									questions with herself. She eagerly waited for Friday night as
									that was 'The Chess Day'.She and her dad had a long ritual of
									playing chess every Friday night. She was sure that this
									time,she will at any cost win her dad in chess.She decided to
									use this opportunity to get answers to her curiosities too.

									cycle for eclipses and i was fascinated with that research
									when you were just a little kid." Saros (in excitement) asks
									again,"What's so wonderful about eclipses,Dad?". Dad happily
									says," In order to unveil that you have to first know
									everything about the eclipses. " "Checkmate",says Saros.

				<div class="questions">1.How do Eclipses occur?</div>
				<div class="answers">
					Eclipses are the scientific phenomena that occur when any celestial
					body comes in shadow of another celestial body which can cause the
					blocking of light for temporary amount of time. There are mainly two
					types of eclipses that occur. They are:Solar eclipses and Lunar
					eclipses.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question-answers">
				<div class="questions">
					2.Why do only some people on Earth see an eclipse at a given time?
				</div>
				<div class="answers">
					The person needs to be within or near the eclipse path to see the
					eclipse and if he/she is out of it,the eclipse is not observed. Lunar
					eclipses are visible from everywhere until the person is at the
					night-side of the Earth but in case of the solar eclipse, the moon
					casts the umbra and penumbra shadow over the Earth. Umbra is the
					shadow that gets smaller as it reaches the Earth and people in umbra
					will see a total eclipse while penumbra is the shadow that gets bigger
					as it reaches the Earth and people in penumbra will only see a partial
					eclipse.

				<div class="questions">
					3.What causes the Sun, Moon, and Earth to align?
				</div>
				<div class="answers">
					The main reason for the Sun,Moon and Earth to align is the inclination
					of the Moon that is tilted about 5.1 degrees with it's ecliptic
					plane,inclination of Earth's orbit around the Sun and the Earth's axis
					is tilted at an angle of about 23.5 degrees with respect to it's
					ecliptic plane and due to nodes(intersection of the Moon's orbit and
					the ecliptic plane) and the different phases of the moon that cause
					the eclipses to occur accordingly.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question-answers">
				<div class="questions">4.How often do eclipses occur?</div>
				<div class="answers">
					Partial lunar eclipses are pretty common and at least two partial
					lunar eclipses occur every year but the total lunar eclipses are
					rare.In case of solar eclipses, they occur every 18 months on the
					Earth.According to NASA, On average, the same spot on the Earth only
					gets to see a solar eclipse for a few minutes about every 375 years.
					After about every 18 years, similar eclipses are occurred as studied
					in the Saros cycle, which is approximately 18 years, 11 days and 8
					hours cycle.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question-answers">
				<div class="questions">
					5.How do scientists know when and where eclipses will occur?
				</div>
				<div class="answers">
					Scientists use the scientific table called Ephemerides that gives the
					positions of celestial objects at a specific time and now in
					advancement with technology, different apps are also available for
					monitoring the positions of the celestial bodies and navigating them
					accordingly.Eclipse season also gives information about the eclipses
					to occur.They use different mathematical models and their
					computational power to predict about the eclipses.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question-answers">
				<div class="questions">
					6.What is the difference between a lunar and solar eclipse?
				</div>
				<div class="answers">
					In solar eclipse, moon comes in between the Sun and the Earth and
					casts a shadow over the Earth.It can further be divided into Total
					Solar Eclipse,Partial Solar Eclipse and Annular Solar Eclipse.
					Similarly, in lunar eclipse, earth comes in between the Sun and the
					Moon which causes the Earth's shadow to fall on the moon. It can
					further be divided into Total Lunar Eclipse and Partial Lunar
					Eclipse.Lunar eclipses occur and remain for some hours and are safe to
					watch with our naked eyes while solar eclipses occur only for few
					minutes and should not be looked at directly.
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question-answers">
				<div class="questions">
					7. What is an eclipse season and why do they occur approximately every
					six months (or twice a year)?
				</div>
				<div class="answers">
					Eclipse seasons occur approximately every six months when the Sun is
					near one of the nodes.They occur due to the axial parallelism of the
					orbital plane of the Moon which is tilted about 5 degrees to the
					Earth's orbital plane. Each eclipse season lasts for about 35 days and
					solar and lunar eclipse can occur only this short period of time.About
					every six months, Earth comes to a sweet spot in its orbit where a
					perfect—or almost perfect—three-way alignment of the Earth, Moon, and
					Sun can occur. Each sweet spot lasts for about 34.5 days: an eclipse
					season.If there is a New Moon near the middle of an eclipse season, it
					will form a straight line with the Earth and the Sun. The result will
					be a total solar eclipse, or an annular solar eclipse, if the Moon is
					too far from Earth to cover the Sun completely. In a similar way, a
					Full Moon near the middle of an eclipse season will produce a total
					lunar eclipse.
